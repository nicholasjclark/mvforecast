# *mvforecast*: Fit, interrogate and forecast multivariate timeseries models in R

This is a work-in-progress package to fit a variety of multivariate timeseries models. At present, vector exponential smoothing models are supported and can be reconciled using temporal hierarchies. Both methods are established in the forecasting field but are little used or known by ecologists.

## Installation

You can install the development version from `GitHub` using:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nicholasjclark/mvforecast")
```
